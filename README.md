This is just a simple Android app that allows people to 
deep link twitter links to Nitter. 

Clone, `npm install`, then `npm run makeDebugApk` to get an apk (uses default debug keystore).

The apk will be at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

This is Android only; if you want to make it for iOS too, you'll have to go through the libraries I used and follow their iOS installation instructions, and also do pod installations.
